**Regression_parser.v5.pl**                         
Perl script to read in QCed returned results files and return ~1200 .csv input files with keys for specific analyses to be read in by rmeta_script.4.r 

**rmeta_caller.pl**                                 
Perl script to read in processed results files and call rmeta_script.4.r to generate all possible meta-analysis forest plots and heterogeneity measures, ordered to run highest priority meta-analyses first.  Filter constant ("$beta_filter") currently set to exclude studies with extreme magnitude linear regression coefficients (magnitude >= ~9.9).  Full run of all meta-analyses took ~40 days
